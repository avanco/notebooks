# Serenata's Notebooks

## What

Serenata de Amor has been acknowledged as a great AI project in Brazil and other countries. It has become not only a project to audit public expenses but also a space of sharing and collaboration. During its history, Serenata has had many people devoted to exploring its datasets through experimental notebooks which could possibly become a Rosie's classifier.

These notebooks from multiple authors are rich assets with which someone can learn a little about data science, Python libraries and core functions, as well as gather ideas for his/her own investigations.

With this in mind, Serenata has opened this repo. You can read notebooks and share your own.
